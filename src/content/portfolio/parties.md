Some party fliers I made. I also have to take some responsibility for the concepts behind them.

It was summer, so we wanted a beachy theme. But also, cows from outer space.

Spring-themed masquerade.

Halloween party, with the conceit that there was just a big conference in town: World wide witches and warlocks. What's scarier than witches? The masks and performances we have to put on at professional conferences and networking events.
