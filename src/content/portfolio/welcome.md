Hi, I'm Patrick. I make things.

- 2D & 3D art
- Games & Experiences
- Software & Websites (like this one)

I'm interested how imagination can be put in the service of universal flourishing and the elimination of want and fear. And also, cartoons!

I made this website using [Astro](https://astro.build), an "islands architecture" framework. It's hosted on GitHub Pages.
