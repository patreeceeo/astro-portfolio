(_Still in development as of April 2025_)

A game inspired by Chip's Challenge. You control a character that can push blocks around, collect items... Standard fair for a tile-based puzzler, _but with zombies!_ The zombies also interact with the tiles. Though their behavior is predefined, the cumulative effect of their movements can be hard to predict.
